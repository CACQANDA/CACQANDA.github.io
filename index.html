                <p>Welcome to our website, designed to provide current students with a valuable resource for their
                    studies. The website contains a collection of summary of notes and past exam questions, carefully
                    curated by the graduating class of 2023, to assist students in their revision and preparation for
                    exams.</p>
                <br>
                <p> As high school students, we understand the importance of having access to a wide range of summary of
                    notes and past exam questions in order to fully prepare for assessments. That's why we created this
                    website, to make that information easily accessible to all students in our school. With a
                    user-friendly interface and organized by subjects, this website aims to make studying more efficient
                    and effective for all students. We have included summary of notes as the first resource, so students
                    can get a quick overview of important concepts and topics before diving into past exam questions.
                </p>
                <p>We believe that this website will be a great asset for students in their academic journey and we are
                    proud to have created something that will benefit future generations. However, we couldn't have done
                    it without the hard work and dedication of our graduating class. We want to take this opportunity to
                    thank them for their contributions and for making this website possible. Thank you for visiting our
                    website and we hope you find it useful.</p>
