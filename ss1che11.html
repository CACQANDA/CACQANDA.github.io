                <h5>Ter<span>ms</span></h5>
                <p>Water: a chemical substance with the chemical formula H2O</p>
                <p>Hydrogen bond: a type of chemical bond that forms between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and a
                    small, highly electronegative atom of another molecule</p>
                <p>pH: a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution</p>
                <p>Water is a chemical substance with the chemical formula H2O. It is a naturally occurring, colorless,
                    odorless, and tasteless liquid that is essential for all forms of life. Water is unique in that it
                    exists in all three states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.
                </p>
                <p>One of the most important properties of water is its ability to form hydrogen bonds. These bonds form
                    between the hydrogen atoms of one water molecule and the oxygen atoms of another water molecule,
                    resulting in a highly cohesive and adhesive substance. This property is responsible for many of
                    water's unique characteristics, such as its high boiling point, high surface tension, and ability to
                    act as a solvent.
                </p>
                <p>Water's pH is neutral, with a pH of 7, which means it is neither acidic nor basic. However, it can
                    act as an acid or a base depending on the presence of other substances. For example, when dissolved
                    carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid, the pH of water decreases.
                </p>
                <p>Water plays a crucial role in living organisms, as it is essential for life. In plants, water is used
                    for photosynthesis and in animals, it is used for digestion and regulating body temperature. Water
                    is also important for the environment as it is a key component in the water cycle and plays a role
                    in shaping the Earth's surface.
                </p>
                <p>In conclusion, water is a chemical substance that is essential for all forms of life, and plays a
                    critical role in many chemical and biological processes. Its unique properties, such as the ability
                    to form hydrogen bonds, high boiling point and high surface tension, make it a valuable substance in
                    many industrial and commercial applications. Understanding the chemical behavior and properties of
                    water is important in understanding its role in the environment, living organisms, and in various
                    industries.
