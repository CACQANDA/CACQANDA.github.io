                <p>Carbon is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. It is a non-metal and is the
                    fourth most abundant element in the universe. Carbon is unique in that it can form a wide variety of
                    chemical compounds, including both inorganic and organic compounds.
                </p>
                <p>Organic compounds are compounds that contain carbon-hydrogen bonds. They are called "organic" because
                    they were originally thought to be produced only by living organisms. However, it is now known that
                    organic compounds can also be produced by non-biological processes. Hydrocarbons are a type of
                    organic compound made of only carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are the primary component of fossil
                    fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas.
                </p>
                <p>Functional groups are specific groups of atoms that determine the chemical properties of an organic
                    compound. Examples of functional groups include alcohols, carboxylic acids, and amines. These
                    functional groups give organic compounds their unique properties and reactivity, and are essential
                    for many chemical reactions in living organisms and industry.
                </p>
                <p>Carbon compounds play a crucial role in many industrial and commercial applications. For example,
                    hydrocarbons are used as fuel sources and as raw materials for the production of plastics and other
                    synthetic materials. Carbon compounds are also important in the pharmaceutical industry, as many
                    drugs contain organic compounds. In living organisms, carbon compounds such as carbohydrates,
                    lipids, and nucleic acids are essential for life.
