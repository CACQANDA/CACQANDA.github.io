                <p> Hydrocarbons are organic compounds made of only carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are the primary
                    component of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Hydrocarbons can be classified into
                    different types based on the types of bonds between carbon atoms.
                </p>
                <p>Alkanes are a type of hydrocarbon with only single bonds between carbon atoms. They are also known as
                    saturated hydrocarbons and have the general formula CnH2n+2. Methane (CH4) and propane (C3H8) are
                    examples of alkanes.
                </p>
                <p>Alkenes are a type of hydrocarbon with at least one double bond between carbon atoms. They are also
                    known as unsaturated hydrocarbons and have the general formula CnH2n. Ethene (C2H4) and propene
                    (C3H6) are examples of alkenes.
                </p>
                <p>Alkynes are a type of hydrocarbon with at least one triple bond between carbon atoms. They have the
                    general formula CnH2n-2. Ethyne (C2H2) and propyne (C3H4) are examples of alkynes.
                </p>
                <p>Aromatic hydrocarbons are a type of hydrocarbon with a ring structure containing alternating single
                    and double bonds between carbon atoms. Examples of aromatic hydrocarbons include benzene (C6H6) and
                    toluene (C7H8). These compounds are characterized by their strong, distinct odors and are often used
                    in the production of chemicals such as dyes and pesticides.
                </p>
                <p>Hydrocarbons are important in the energy industry as they are the primary source of fuel for
                    transportation and electricity generation. They are also used as raw materials in the chemical
                    industry to produce a wide range of products such as plastics, solvents, and fertilizers. The
                    extraction, transportation, and burning of hydrocarbons can have a significant impact on the
                    environment, and it is important to use these resources responsibly and develop sustainable
                    alternatives.
