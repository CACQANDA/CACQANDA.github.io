                <h5>Objec<span>tives</span></h5>
                <p>
                <p> Understand the definition and scope of chemistry</p>
                <p> Learn about the different branches of chemistry and their applications.</p>
                <p> Explore the scientific method and its importance in chemistry</p>

                <p> Chemistry: the branch of science that deals with the properties and composition of matter, and the
                    changes that matter undergoes.</p>
                <p> Matter: anything that has mass and occupies space.</p>
                <p> Properties: the characteristics of a substance that can be observed or measured.</p>
                <p> Composition: the arrangement and types of atoms or molecules in a substance</p>
                <p>Changes: the process of matter going from one form or state to another</p>
                <p> Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the properties and composition of matter, and the
                    changes that matter undergoes. It examines the building blocks of the natural world including atoms,
                    molecules, and chemical reactions. Understanding chemistry is important in many fields including
                    medicine, environmental science, and technology. </p>
                <p> Chemistry can be divided into several branches such as analytical chemistry, which deals with the
                    identification and characterization of chemicals and materials, and organic chemistry, which is the
                    study of carbon-based compounds. Physical chemistry is the study of the behavior of matter and
                    energy, and biochemistry is the study of the chemical processes that occur in living organisms.
                </p>
                <p>The scientific method is an important tool used in chemistry to conduct research and experiments. It
                    is a systematic process that includes the observation of a phenomenon, the formulation of a
                    hypothesis, the design and execution of experiments to test the hypothesis, and the analysis and
                    interpretation of the results. This process allows scientists to make accurate and reliable
                    conclusions about the natural world.</p>
