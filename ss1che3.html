                <p> Particulate nature of matter: the idea that matter is made up of tiny particles.</p>
                <p> Atoms: the basic unit of matter</p>
                <p> Molecules: two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together</p>
                <p> Compounds: a substance made up of two or more different types of atoms</p>
                <p>Elements: a substance made up of only one type of atom</p>
                <p>Physical properties: characteristics of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing
                    the substance's composition</p>
                <p>Chemical properties: characteristics of a substance that describe its ability to participate in
                    chemical reactions</p>
                <p> The particulate nature of matter refers to the idea that all matter is made up of tiny particles,
                    such as atoms and molecules. These particles are in constant motion and interact with one another to
                    form different types of matter.
                    Atoms are the basic unit of matter and are made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons. These atoms
                    can bond together to form molecules, which are two or more atoms that are chemically bonded
                    together. Compounds are made up of two or more different types of atoms, while elements are made up
                    of only one type of atom.
                </p>
                <p> The properties of particles in matter can be divided into two categories: physical properties and
                    chemical properties. Physical properties include characteristics of a substance that can be observed
                    or measured without changing the substance's composition, such as density, melting point, and
                    boiling point. Chemical properties describe a substance's ability to participate in chemical
                    reactions, such as flammability and reactivity.
                </p>
                <p> In conclusion, the particulate nature of matter refers to the idea that all matter is made up of
                    tiny particles, such as atoms and molecules. Understanding the properties of these particles and how
                    they interact is important in understanding the behavior of matter and its various forms.</p>
