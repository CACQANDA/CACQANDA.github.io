                <p> In chemistry, symbols, formulae and equations are used to represent the composition and behavior of
                    matter. The use of symbols, formulae and equations is essential for understanding and communicating
                    chemical concepts.
                    Chemical symbols are short notation used to represent elements in a chemical formula or equation.
                    These symbols are derived from the element's name or Latin name. For example, the symbol for the
                    element hydrogen is H and the symbol for the element oxygen is O.

                </p>
                <p> Formulae are used to represent the composition of a compound. A chemical formula provides
                    information about the type and number of atoms in a compound. For example, the formula for water is
                    H2O, which indicates that water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
                </p>
                <p> Equations are used to represent a chemical reaction. A chemical equation shows the reactants, the
                    substances that undergo change, and the products, the substances that are formed as a result of the
                    chemical reaction. For example, the equation for the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen to form water
                    is 2H2 + O2 â†’ 2H2O.</p>
                <p>Balancing chemical equations is the process of ensuring that the number of atoms of each element is
                    the same on both sides of the equation. This is important because the law of conservation of mass
                    states that in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the reactants must be equal to the total mass
                    of the products.
                    In conclusion, symbols, formulae and equations are essential tools in chemistry for understanding
                    and communicating chemical concepts. They are used to represent the composition and behavior of
                    matter and play an important role in understanding chemical reactions and the law of conservation of
                    mass.
