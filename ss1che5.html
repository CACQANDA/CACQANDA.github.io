                </p>
                <p> Combination reactions: chemical reactions in which two or more substances combine to form a new
                    compound</p>
                <p> Decomposition reactions: chemical reactions in which a single compound is broken down into simpler
                    substances</p>
                <p> Synthesis reactions: chemical reactions in which two or more simple substances combine to form a
                    more complex compound</p>
                <p>Reactivity: the tendency of a substance to participate in chemical reactions</p>
                <p>Energy: the ability to do work or cause change</p>
                <p> Chemical combination refers to the process by which atoms or molecules come together to form a new
                    compound. This process is also known as chemical bonding. In a chemical combination, the atoms or
                    molecules that come together must have the ability to form chemical bonds.
                    There are three types of chemical combination: combination reactions, decomposition reactions, and
                    synthesis reactions. Combination reactions occur when two or more substances combine to form a new
                    compound. Decomposition reactions occur when a single compound is broken down into simpler
                    substances. Synthesis reactions occur when two or more simple substances combine to form a more
                    complex compound.

                </p>
                <p> The reactivity of the substances and the amount of energy present during the reaction can affect the
                    outcome of a chemical combination. Substances that are highly reactive will tend to participate in
                    chemical reactions more readily than those that are less reactive. The amount of energy present
                    during a reaction can also affect the outcome, as some reactions require a certain amount of energy
                    to occur.
                </p>
                <p> In conclusion, chemical combination is the process by which atoms or molecules come together to form
                    a new compound. This process is important in understanding the properties of matter and the behavior
                    of chemical reactions. The reactivity of the substances and the amount of energy present during the
                    reaction can affect the outcome of a chemical combination.</p>
