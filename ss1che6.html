                <p>Separation technique: a method used to separate the components of a mixture</p>
                <p>Mixture: a combination of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded together</p>
                <p>Distillation: a separation technique that utilizes differences in boiling points to separate
                    components of a mixture</p>
                <p>Filtration: a separation technique that uses a filter to separate solid particles from a liquid or
                    gas</p>
                <p>Chromatography: a separation technique that utilizes the different affinities of compounds for a
                    stationary and mobile phase to separate them</p>
                <p>Crystallization: a separation technique that utilizes the differences in solubility of compounds to
                    separate them</p>
                <p>Separation techniques are methods used to separate the components of a mixture. Mixtures are
                    combinations of two or more substances that are not chemically bonded together.
                </p>
                <p> One common separation technique is distillation, which utilizes differences in boiling points to
                    separate components of a mixture. This technique is commonly used in the production of alcohol and
                    essential oils.
                </p>
                <p> Filtration is another separation technique that uses a filter to separate solid particles from a
                    liquid or gas. This technique is commonly used in water treatment and the production of coffee.
                </p>
                <p> Chromatography is a separation technique that utilizes the different affinities of compounds for a
                    stationary and mobile phase to separate them. This technique is commonly used in the analysis of
                    complex mixtures such as in the analysis of blood or in the purification of drugs.
                </p>
                <p>Crystallization is a separation technique that utilizes the differences in solubility of compounds to
                    separate them. This technique is commonly used in the purification of chemicals and in the
                    production of sugar and salt.
                </p>
                <p> Each separation technique has its own advantages and limitations and the choice of technique will
                    depend on the properties of the mixture and the desired end product.
                <p>In addition to the techniques mentioned above, there are several other separation techniques used in
                    industry and laboratory settings. Some examples include:</p>
                <p>- Centrifugation: a technique that uses centrifugal force to separate components of a mixture based
                    on their density or size.</p>
                <p>- Extraction: a technique that uses a solvent to separate components of a mixture based on their
                    solubility.</p>
                <p>- Decantation: a technique that relies on the differences in density of the components of a mixture
                    to separate them.</p>
                <p>- Sublimation: a technique that uses differences in the physical states of components to separate
                    them.</p>
                <p>Each of these techniques has its own set of advantages and limitations and the choice of technique
                    will depend on the properties of the mixture and the desired end product.</p>
                <p>It's important to note that many separation techniques can be combined or used in sequence to achieve
                    a desired level of purity or separation of the components of a mixture. </p>
