                <h5>Objec<span>tives</span></h5>
                <p>
                <p> Understand the properties and behavior of acids and bases</p>
                <p> Learn about the different methods used to measure acidity and basicity</p>
                <p> Explore the chemical reactions and applications of acids, bases, and salts</p>
                <h5>Ter<span>ms</span></h5>
                <p>Acid: a substance that donates hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water</p>
                <p>Base: a substance that accepts hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water</p>
                <p>Salt: a neutral compound that is formed by the chemical reaction between an acid and a base</p>
                <p>pH: a measure of acidity or basicity on a scale of 0-14, where 7 is neutral, less than 7 is acidic
                    and greater than 7 is basic</p>
                <p>Acids and bases are important classes of compounds that play a fundamental role in many chemical
                    reactions and processes. Acids are defined as substances that donate hydrogen ions (H+) when
                    dissolved in water, while bases are defined as substances that accept hydrogen ions when dissolved
                    in water.
                </p>
                <p> The acidity or basicity of a substance can be measured using the pH scale, which ranges from 0 to
                    14. A pH of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Common
                    examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and acetic acid (CH3COOH).
                    Common examples of bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), and ammonia
                    (NH3).
                </p>
                <p>Acids and bases can react to form a neutral compound called a salt. This reaction is known as a
                    neutralization reaction. For example, hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) react to
                    form salt and water:
                    HCl + NaOH â†’ NaCl + H2O
                </p>
                <p> Acids and bases have a wide range of applications in industry and everyday life. Acids are used in
                    the production of fertilizers, cleaning agents, and food and drink products, while bases are used in
                    cleaning agents, personal care products, and medicine. Salts are used in a variety of applications,
                    including food preservation, water treatment, and the production of fertilizers and other chemicals.
